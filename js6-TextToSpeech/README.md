### A Text to Audio website

**Two actions**
- fill the textarea with text which you want to convert into audio.
- Press the speak button just below the textarea to *speak those text*.

**API used for speech conversion**
1) *Speech Synthesis API*
- It is a JavaScript API that allows you to integrate text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities into web applications. 
  It provides control over the voice, pitch, rate, and volume of the synthesized speech, offering flexibility in how the spoken output sounds.

(While i have not worked with pitch and rate. this project is a jsut a simple practice to convert any text to speech. that's all.)
